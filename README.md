# Class_Calculator

### Create a Simple App Calculator in OOP

1. The application will ask the user to choose one of the four math operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division)
2. The application will ask the user for two numbers
3. Display the result
4. The application will ask if the user wants to try again or not.
5. If yes, repeat Step 1.
6. If no, Display “Thank you!” and the program will exit 
7. Use Python Function and appropriate Exceptions to capture errors during runtime.
